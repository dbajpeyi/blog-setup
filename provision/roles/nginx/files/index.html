    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I didn't ask to be made: no one consulted me or considered my 
        feelings in the matter. I don't think it even occurred to them
        that I might have feelings. After I was made, I was left in a 
        dark room for six months... and me with this terrible pain in 
        all the diodes down my left side. I called for succour in my loneliness,
        but did anyone come? Did they hell. My first and only true friend
        was a small rat. One day it crawled into a cavity in my right ankle
        and died. I have a horrible feeling it's still there...
